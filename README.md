# Chrome Web Store Extensions Privacy Policy

To better protect your privacy I provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

## Collection of Routine Information

My Chrome extensions or apps do not collect information about their users. Since no data is collected by me in my Chrome extensions or apps, no data can be sold to third parties.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of December 10, 2022 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If I make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, I will notify you either through the email address you have provided me, or by placing a prominent notice on my website, app, or extension.
